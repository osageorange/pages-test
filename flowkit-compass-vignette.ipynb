A common scenario is where an analyst uses a rectangle gate to select a sub-population that have large values of a marker; while the rectangle gate forces a technical maximum value for that marker, the intent of the analyst may be to include any event with a value above some threshold, in which case the maximum value imposed by the rectangle gate is set arbitrarily high so as to no exclude any events above it. In such a case, the maximum value is not relevant and we can simply focus on the minimum value for the gate.\n",
